## Data Science Production Project

### This project consists of three integrated parts:

### Notebooks:
 This part contains the exploratory data analysis, the initial model industrialization, and the final industrialized model. The initial model industrialization notebook shows the step-by-step process of building and evaluating the model. The final industrialized notebook uses only two functions: one for training and testing the model, and another for making predictions on new data.

### House_prices: 
This part contains the scripts of the code extracted from the model_industrialization_draft notebook. It is divided into three modules: preprocessing, training, and inference. The code is designed to take a dataframe as input and perform the necessary operations.

### Models: 
This part contains the saved versions of the deployed machine learning model (HGBoost), the standard scaler, and the ordinal encoder that were used in the project.

This project follows the best practices of data science production, such as flake8 compliance, type hinting, and PEP8 standards.
